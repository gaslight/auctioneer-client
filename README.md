# Auctioneer Client

This is the client side repo for the Auctioneer example app of a Codemash 2016 talk: "Low Ceremony Microservices with Elixir".
You'll need to have the [server](http://github.com/gaslight/auctioneer) side app up
and running on port 4000 or else chage app/auction-app.ts accordingly.

To get the client side up and running:

```
npm install -g jspm
npm install -g live-server
jspm install
npm install
live-server
```
